            <h2>Company History</h2>
            <p>
                A division of Emeritus Corporation, Bock Associates is an experienced national firm that
                specializes in PASRR assessment services tailored to the needs of state human service
                programs. Bock Associtates was one of the first national providers of PASRR services and
                was involved in PASRR related activities prior to the passage of the legislation. Since
                the release of the regulations, we have performed all phases of the PASRR program 
                implementation, management, and review. In addition to completing over 300,000 Level II 
                assessments, Bock Associates has performed the following PASRR activities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed unique sets of assessment protocols and training material</li>
                <li>
                    Reviewed and processed over 150,000 Level I Clinical Reviews and Medicaid Nursing
                    Facility Level of Care screens
                </li>
                <li>Recruited and trained hundreds of clinical professionals to complete assessments</li>
                <li>
                    Created computerized PASRR tracking systems, used by staff, assessors, and clients
                    to collect and analyze data on thousands of clients and assessments. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Bock Associates was founded to meet a growing, national demand for management consulting 
                related to the Minnesota Developmental Programming System (MDPS), a computerized 
                assessment and individualized treatment planning system, developed by Dr. Bock, for
                individuals with developmental disabilities (DD). The MDPS was designed to assist
                intermediate care facilities(ICF) in complying with new Medicaid regulations, which 
                required the ICFs to conduct standardized functional assessments of, and develop 
                individual plans of care for all residents. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1985, Bock Associates was awarded contracts from the Illinois Department of Public
                Aid, the Indiana Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities, and the 
                Indiana Department of Public Welfare to collect, manage and track data on approximately
                11,000 individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities, who were residing
                in nursing facilities in their respective states. Illinois and Indiana were two of three
                Midwestern states that were cited by CMS for nursing facility certification deficiencies.
                Bock Associates was the prime contractor assisting both states in complying with CMS's 
                directive. CMS's experience in these two states prompted the eventual passage of the
                PASRR legislation OBRA '87. In 1988 Bock Assocaites was awarded its first PASRR related 
                contract from the State of Louisiana. Since that time, we have provided PASRR consultation
                to twelve states in seven CMS regions. 
            </p>
            <h2>PASRR History</h2>
            <p>
                In 1982, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Sciences proposed significant changes in 
                the nursing facility survey and certification program. The proposal was very controversial,
                and its implementation was delayed until the National Academy of Sciences' IOM Committee 
                on Nursing Home Regulation completed a comprehensive study of nursing facility regulations.
                Concurrent with the research being conducted by the IOM Committee, CMS indentified three 
                states in which there were thought to be large numbers of individuals with ID/RC 
                inappreprietely placed in nursing facilities. These three states were ordered to identify
                individuals who were residing in nursing facilities and who had or were suspected of having
                a diagnosis of ID/RS, assess their needs for service, develop active treatment plans, and
                research alternative placements for those individuals who had been inappropriately placed
                in nursing facilities. These states were informed that failure to comply with CMS's directive
                would result in de-certification from participating in the Medicaid program. Bock 
                Associates played a key role in assisting two of the states, Illinois and Indiana, in 
                complying with CMS's directives. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1987, Congress relied heavily on the recommendations from the IOM and CMS's 
                experience to develop Section 1919(f)(8)(A) of the Social Security Act. The legislative
                intent of these amendments, and CMS's subsequent regulations, was to ensure appropriate 
                placement for individuals with mental illness, intellectual disabilities, or related 
                condition. Congress enacted a series of technical amendments to OBRA '87 in OBRA '90 and 
                on November 23rd, 1992, CMS published its interim final rule for PASRR in the Federal Register.
                The requirements of the final rule became effective on January 29th, 1993. On October 19th, 
                1996 the President signed P.L. 104-315 (the Act), which amended Title XIX of the Social
                Security Act to replace "annual resident reviews" with "significant change reviews" for 
                those residents experiencing a substantial positive or negative chane in their physical 
                or mental condition.
            </p>
            <p>
                To meet the requirements of OBRA '87, OBRA '90 and CMS's final rule for PASRR and P.L. 104-315,
                each state must have process in place that responds to the following statutory requirements
                specified in the Federal legislation:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Completion of Level I screen to identify, for PASRR referral, those individuals
                    applying for admission to a Medicaid-certified nursing facility for which it appears 
                    that a diagnosis of MI and/or ID/RC is likely, regardless of their source of payment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Completion of a comprehensive PASRR Level II evaluation of residents who have 
                    experienced a change in their physical or mental condition or applicants to 
                    Medicaid-certified nursing facilities who are identified in the Level I screening as
                    suspected of having a diagnosis of MI and/or ID/RC. This evaluation is personalized
                    to the needs of the individual with the goal of recommending dervice and placement 
                    options that provide the individual with the opportunity to flourish in the least 
                    restrictive environment that is capable of meeting their unique needs. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    An accessible and timely appeals process for individuals who feel adversely affected 
                    by the Level II evaluation process. 
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In February 2020, CMS published the first significant proposed PASRR rule changes in over
                two decades. Following the release of the proposed changes stakeholders were encouraged
                to read and submit comments and questions for consideration. Due to the high number of 
                questions and comments submitted, coupled with the timing of the pandemic, responses to 
                submitted questions and any subsequent modifications to the proposed rule have not been 
                released. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The proposed rule changes address many areas including: timeliness, diagnostic criteria
                for SMI and ID, additional Level II exceptions, and specialized service definition.
